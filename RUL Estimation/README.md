Estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is a crucial aspect of prognostics. RUL indicates the duration remaining before a failure is likely to occur, based on the machine's current age, condition, and operational history. The code presents CiRNN models developed using well known NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set. The details are avilable in
